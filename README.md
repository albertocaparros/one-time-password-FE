# One time password exercise

Tech stack:
 - React
 - Styled-components for CSS
 - React router

Details:
 - You can type numbers only
 - One-time password can be hardcoded in the app, no external/fake API requests
 - If password is correct, show “Redirecting to your account…” text, wait for a few seconds and then redirect to new page
 - “Request a new OTP” button should be showed after, for example, 30 seconds once you open the page. Once you click - hide the button and restart the timer
 - Copy-paste should work
