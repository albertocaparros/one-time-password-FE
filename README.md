# One time password exercise

Tech stack:
 ⁃ React
 ⁃ styled-components for CSS
 ⁃ React router

Details:
 ⁃ you can type numbers only
 ⁃ one-time password can be hardcoded in the app, no external/fake API requests
 ⁃ if password is correct, show “Redirecting to your account…” text, wait for a few seconds and then redirect to new page
 ⁃ “Request a new OTP” button should be showed after, for example, 30 seconds once you open the page. Once you click - hide the button and restart the timer
 ⁃ copy-paste should work
